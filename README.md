## Linear_regression_analysis

* For this analysis NYT_HP_Pageviews was assumed as the independent variable and WC_pagevies as the dependent one.

* Rvalue or correlation coeffient was close to zero (0.00615), which means that there's no correlation between both variables. Also, pvalue was 0.924 which is greater than 0.05 meaning that the regression is not statistically significant.
